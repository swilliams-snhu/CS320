How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
When I test my code, the first thing that I try to do is ensure that it functions as intended. Once I have my code in a working manner, I then adopt the mindset of trying to break it. I see what inputs it can handle, how it behaves whenever it gets something that it shouldn’t, and what happens. This ensures that the code is robust enough to handle user and operator error and won’t crash on them if they fat finger a semicolon in the name input field. It is important to find all the bugs possible during the testing phase to avoid a 3 a.m. phone call from a customer because their system crashed.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I do my best to gather all of the user requirements in the beginning so I can accurately design my code. From there, I make sure that all of the requirements are somehow met within the design. Then, I review the design with the customer to make sure that they approve it, and after they sign off on it I begin developing. This covers me as the developer on scope creep and the customer to make sure I implement everything I said I would.

How do I approach designing software?
I gather all of the requirements and make sure that I follow best practices. This design can begin with a simple outline or flowchart of the system. Then it can be expanded on and add details to the skeleton.
